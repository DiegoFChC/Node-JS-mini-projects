# 📁 Node JS Mini Projects
This repository contains a collection of small, focused Node.js mini-projects created for learning purposes.
Each project explores a different core concept of Node.js, such as:

* Working with the filesystem (fs)
* Working with CLI input/output
* Asynchronous programming
* Streams
* Modules and architecture
* Networking
* Timers and events
* And more as the collection grows

The goal of this folder is to practice Node.js through practical and incremental mini-projects, building up knowledge step by step while maintaining clean structure and readable code.

## 📌 Current Projects

1. **💻 Custom Console (Two Versions)**
A small custom shell written in Node.js, built in two modes:

* `index_consola.js`: Reads user commands directly from the terminal using readline.
* `index_text_file.js`: Uses a .txt file as a simulated console, detecting changes with fs.watch.

2. **🔔 Node Notification System (v1)**
A small notification system built with Node.js using the native `EventEmitter`.

3. **🔔 Node Notification System (v2) - Persistence - Logs**
A modular notification system built with Node.js, designed to learn event-driven architecture, persistence, and logging using the native EventEmitter.

4. **🧩 Node REST API**
A simple REST API built with Node.js using only native modules (http, fs, url, etc.), without Express or any external framework.
